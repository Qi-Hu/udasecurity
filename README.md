# udasecurity

This is a home security application, which is the third project for the [Java Programming Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/java-programming-nanodegree--nd079) program at Udacity. The project was built based on the [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/cd0384-java-application-deployment-projectstarter). This application tracks the status of sensors, monitors camera input, and changes the alarm state of the system based on inputs. Users can arm the system for when theyâ€™re home or away as well as disarm the system.
